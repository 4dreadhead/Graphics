### To run application:
- Install Python3
- Install 'requirements.txt' ( pip3 install -r "your_path_to_folder/requirements.txt" )
- Run file 'lib/app.py'

---

## Description
### The application consists of 4 methods:
1. Drawing triangles based on algorithms:
 - Non-Symmetric Digital Differential Analyzer,
 - Bresenham algorithm;
2. Transformations in the plane (rotation around a point);


3. Transformations from three-dimensional coordinate system to image on the screen (without OpenGL), transformations in space 
(rotating around axes, moving, zooming in/out of a figure);

 
4. Pixel-by-pixel rendering of visible surfaces using the z-buffer algorithm (without OpenGL).
